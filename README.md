### With Electron + React (with https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate)

#### Work in progress...

##### My motivation, message sent to Yandex team:
```
Hello Yandex friends,

after several tests on ClickHouse, I felt the power of this tool.

I would like to thank the wonderful work done by the Yandex team.

We are already using the company where I work, Zenvia, and is bringing us great solutions for data analysis.

However we are having some difficulties in making it available for "non-technical" users to do querys, monitor features and everything else. For the tools of interaction with ClickHouse are very bad and full of bug (like Tabix).

ClickHouse has to have a tool similar to that of MemSQL for example, I'm sure it will greatly increase the use of ClickHouse throughout the community.

Thinking about that, I decided to start a project to make it possible, it's right at the beginning, but I have good visions of how it should be.

This is the initial repository -> https://github.com/jonatasfreitasv/DashHouse
The name I'm still thinking, if you have suggestions hehe :).

My vision with some features -> https://github.com/jonatasfreitasv/DashHouse/projects

I want to do something really relevant, to be proud of Yandex and your team.

If anyone wants to contribute to the project, I will be very grateful (jonatasfreitasv@gmail.com).

I need UX / UI and React professionals.

If you can publish this work so that I can get more contributors, I would appreciate it.

Thank you again, and got o work hard!!!
```
